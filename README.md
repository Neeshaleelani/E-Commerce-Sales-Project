3. **Sub-Category Insights:** Analyze sales trends for different sub-categories.  
4. **Monthly Profit Analysis:** Calculate monthly profits and identify peak and lowest profit months.  
5. **Category and Sub-Category Profit Analysis:** Examine profit trends by product category and sub-category.  
6. **Customer Segment Analysis:** Evaluate sales and profit contributions from different customer segments.  
7. **Sales-to-Profit Ratio:** Analyze the efficiency of converting sales into profit across categories and segments.  

#### Libraries Used
